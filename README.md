FCC AppFilter
==========

A web scraper that gets cellular application information from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and filters it for the user.

This scraper is part of a two-program scheme; this program grabs the data and stores it into the SQLite database here on the site.

When complete, the second program will be a ScraperWiki "View" with an interface for user input and direct search/download capability.
