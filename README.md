FCC AppFilter
==========

A web scraper that gets cellular application information from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and filters it for the user.

***Note***: This program is designed for Scraperwiki.com and uses their servers for its database. It can be found on that site at: https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/fcc_appfilter/

This scraper is part of a two-program scheme; this program grabs the data and stores it into the SQLite database on the ScraperWiki site.

When complete, the second program will be a ScraperWiki "View" with an interface for user input and direct search/download capability.
